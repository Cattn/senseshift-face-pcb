[spec here](https://github.com/senseshift/senseshift-hardware/tree/main/Devices/Face%20Interface/ESP32%20+%20Integrated%20PWM)

gerber file, .epro, stl file are all in [releases here](https://github.com/Cattn/senseshift-face-pcb/releases/latest)

## Disclaimer:

I am an idiot. I haven't tested these yet, so there is a chance they don't work. I'll update this when I verify them.
